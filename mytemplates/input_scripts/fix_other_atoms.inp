! We do not want to allow atoms not known natively by the CHARMM force field (i.e. those generated
   ! by GENRTF) to move during the minimization. Therefore, we define all residues that CHARMM's force
   ! field does know about and use a constraint to fix all other atoms. Note, this may be overridden
   ! by the user.
