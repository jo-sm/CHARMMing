<h2 class="intro">Introduction to CHARMM</h2>

<p class="intro">CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics) is a versatile and widely-used molecular simulation program with broad application to
  many-particle systems. It is generally used to gain insight into how complex biomolecular systems behave in nature. It provides a large suite of simulation and
  analysis tools that encompass numerous computational methods.</p>
<br />

<p class="intro">Because it is a large and complicated program, CHARMM can be intimidating for a new user. The series of tutorials on this web site will help
  guide you through setting up basic simulations. You can look at the input and output files produced on the <b>View Process Files</b> page and you can download
  them from the <b>Download Files</b> page. You should do this in order to get a sense of which CHARMM commands are used to perform various tasks. You should also
  explore the commands in more detail in the documentation (available on <a href="http://www.charmm.org/html/documentation/chmdoc.html">
  the CHARMM home page, www.charmm.org</a>. A complete tutorial is available at <a href="http://www.charmmtutorial.org">www.charmmtutorial.org</a>
  or by clicking <b>View the tutorial</b> in the side menu.</p>
<br />

<h2 class="intro">Protein structure and coordinate files</h2>

<p class="intro">To get started with this lesson download the coordinate file and protein structure file below. A Protein Structure File (PSF) contains bond information 
  such as angles, torsion (dihedral) angles, and improper torsion angles. This makes a PSF vital to energy calculations in CHARMM. A CHARMM coordinate File (COOR, CRD), stores 
  the cartesian coordinates of each atom along with its residue and segment identification. Groups of atoms form commonly-used subunits called residues (e.g., an amino acid, 
  such as Lysine, is a residue). Residues are further grouped into chains or segments which represent major functional groups or different observed conformations. Th PDB files 
  contain the same information, but in a different format.</p>
<br />

<p class="intro">In order for CHARMM to build a model of a molecule, it needs to know its structure (contained in the protein structure file) and the coordinates of its constituent
  atoms. To read this in via CHARMMing, go to the <b>Submit Structure</b> page, 
  select "Upload my own CRD/PSF files" and upload the following two files (be sure to select lesson 1 as the lesson your upload is associated with):<br>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/charmming/lessons/download/lesson1/1water.crd">1water.crd</a> (the coordinate file)</li>
    <li><a href="/charmming/lessons/download/lesson1/1water.psf">1water.psf</a> (the protein structure file)</li>
  </ul>
<br />
<p class="intro">Once you have done so, come back to this page and you should see a confirmation that the files were uploaded correctly.</p>
<br />

   <p class="intro"><font color="red"> Step 1: Upload Done </font></p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">Congratulations! You successfully uploaded both the CRD and PSF files! These files describe the structure of a single water molecule. We will
     be using this model to build up an entire water box.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">In order to build the box, it is necessary to use CHARMMing's solvation functionality. Usually, solvation is used to put a macromolecule into solvent,
      but in this case we are just using it to build up a large water structure. We will solvate the water molecule in a Rhombic Dodecahedron (RHDO) structure. The RHDO is
      a convex polyhedron that has 12 rhombuses as faces. Since it approximates a sphere, it is the most efficient method for solvating globular proteins (actual spheres
      are not used because there is no crystal structure for them). To solvate, look to the left menu bar under <i>Calculations</i> and select <b>Solvate.</b></p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">For the <font style="fixed">Solvation structure parameters</font> dialog, select the RHDO shape and for the size select &quot;<font style="fixed">Let the GUI
      take care of it for me</font>.&quot; When this is selected, CHARMMing will automatically create a CHARMM input script that calculates the appropriate size of the RHDO structure. It will 
      take the largest x,y,z coordinate and add 10 Angstroms to that value. The 10 Angstroms can be changed by changing the value in the textbox. Change the value to 15 
      and press submit.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">In addition, we don't want CHARMM to use any patches that are meant for protein or nucleic acid segments. CHARMMing automatically will detect this and will not apply
    a patch. Leave the number of disulfide patches set at 0. One you have set this up, go ahead and submit the solvation job.</p>

   <p class="intro"><font color="red"> Step 2: Solvation Running </font></p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">The solvation job is still in progress but you can read ahead.</p>
   <br />

  <p class="intro">For the next step, you will minimize the water structure. The purpose of minimization is to try to find the conformation (position of the atoms in the protein) that
    has the lowest possible energy. Ideally, the conformation produced would be the structure at absolute zero. This is a commonly done to remove bad atom placement (often caused
    by problems in the crystal or NMR structure). For a realistic dynamics simulation, the structure is then heated back to the desired temperature. Two common alogorithms for
    minimization are Steepest Descent (SD) and Adopted-Basis Newton-Rhapson (ABNR).</p>
  <br />

  <p class="intro">In order to minimize your water structure, go to <b>Minimize</b> in the left hand menu, select the water molecule, set Steepest Descent to 1000 and ABNR to 1000. The
    TOLG parameter specifies the minimum average gradient that can be reached before the simulation stops. The average gradient is essentially a mesaure of how &quot;steep&quot; the
    energy surface is. The closer this is to 0, the closer to being converged the minimization is. For this example, set the tolg to 0.01. Additionally, since dynamics uses periodic
    boundary conditions (PBC) we need to use them in the minimization as well (otherwise there will be problems with the dynamics simulation), so make sure that the &quot;Use PBC&quot;
    option is set.
   </p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">Please wait until solvation of the solvated structure is complete before starting the minimization calculation.</p>

   <br />

   <p class="intro">Minimization is currently running. Until it is finished you can read ahead.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">The next step will involve running Molecular Dynamics (MD). MD applies Newton's laws of motion coupled with electrostatic and van der Waals forces to simulate 
     how the system would act in a &quot;natural state.&quot; CHARMMing supports two types of MD simulations: heating and equilibration. Heating gradually adds energy to the system
     while equilibration runs keep the environment constant. Because we brought the system to a low energy conformation, we should start by heating the system gradually. Leave the 
     number of steps at 1000, the starting temperature at 210.15 K, the final temprature at 310.15 K (physiological temperature), temperature increment at 10 K, steps between temperature 
     increases (IHTFRQ) to 100, and temperature of bath at 310.15 K. This increases the the temperature 300 K over the 1000 step simulation, which is a more rapid increase than is
     usually used.</p>
