  <ul>
    <li> Submit a structure to the redox module. </li>
    <li> Calculate the environmental contribution to the reduction potential (&#916<i>G</i><sub>out</sub>). </li>
    <li> Calculate the reduction potential (<i>E</i>&#176). </li>
    <li> Determine the change in <i>E</i>&#176 with pH.</li>
    <li> Determine contribution of residue to <i>E</i>&#176.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="intro">Reduction Potential</h2>

<p class="intro">
This is a paragraph on the importance of the reduction potential. It's a driving force for electron transfer!
</p>
<br />

<p class="intro">
This is a paragraph on calculating the reduction potential using continuum electrostatics. It's calculated as 
<br><br>
<i>E</i>&#176 = -&#916<i>G</i><sub>in</sub>/n<i>F</i> - &#916<i>G</i><sub>out</sub>/n<i>F</i> - &#916<i>G</i><sub>SHE</sub>/n<i>F</i>
<br /><br />
Where n is the number of electons being transferred, <i>F</i> is Faradays constant, <i>G</i><sub>in</sub> is the intrinsic contribution to the reduction potential, and <i>G</i><sub>out</sub> is the contribution of the environment. <i>G</i><sub>in</sub> is calculated for each cluster and charge stat using density functional theory (DFT). Since this is a computationally expensive calculation, a database of <i>G</i><sub>in</sub> values are stored in CHARMMing. 
</p>
<br />

<p class="intro">
&#916<i>G</i><sub>out</sub> is calcualated using continuum electrostatics, which is relatively fast calculation and can be performed on the CHARMMing web server. &#916<i>G</i><sub>out</sub> is the change in solvation energy with reduction of the redox site calculated as
<br><br>
&#916<i>G</i><sub>out</sub> = &#916<i>G</i><sub>sol</sub>(Reduced) - &#916<i>G</i><sub>sol</sub>(Oxidized).

<h2 class="intro">Iron-Sulfur Proteins</h2>

<p class="intro">
Iron-sulfur proteins serve as a good example of redox protein. We'll use them as a test case in this lesson.
</p>
<br />

<p class="intro">
In order for CHARMM to build a model of a molecule, it needs to know its structure (contained in the protein structure file) and the coordinates of its constituent
  atoms. To read this in via CHARMMing, go to the <b>Submit Structure</b> page,
  select "Upload my own CRD/PSF files" and upload the following two files (be sure to select lesson 6 as the lesson your upload is associated with):
<br>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/charmming/lessons/download/lesson6/1CKU.pdb">1CKU.pdb</a> (the coordinate file)</li>
  </ul>
<br />
<p class="intro">Once you have done so, come back to this page and you should see a confirmation that the files were uploaded correctly.</p>
<br />

{% if lesson6 %}

   <p class="intro"><font color="red"> Step 1: Upload Done </font></p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">Congratulations! You successfully uploaded both the PDB files! This file contains the atomic coordinates for the protein and iron-sulfur cluster. We will
     be using this model calculate the reduction potential of the protein.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">Before we calulate the reduction potential of this structure, we must prepare the structure for calculation. First, select <b>Build Working Structure</b> under the 
   <i>Structures</i> tab in the menu to the left.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">This PDB file contains two proteins, which are part of the same asymmetric unit in the crystal structure. For the redox calulations, we are only interested in the
      contribution of the protein segment 'a' (a-pro) to the segment 'a' redox site (a-bad), so we will not include the other segments. Select the check boxes for these two segments.</p>
   <br />

   <p class="intro">The redox site is categorized as a 'bad' segment type since redox site parmeters are not included in the CHARMM package. To account for this, CHARMMing includes
      supplemental topology and parameter files for a variety of redox sites. To use these topology and parameter files, select <font style="fixed"><u>'Use only for REDOX calculations'</u></font> 
      from the drop-down list in the a-bad row. Select submit to build the working structure.</p>

   calculation (click on 'Calculate Enegy'). </p>

   <p class="intro">*Note: Do to the setup of CHARMMing, you <b>MUST</b> calculate the energy prior to performing a redox calculation.</p>
