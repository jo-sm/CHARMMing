  This is a slightly modified version of the "cifparse" library from
the Nucleic Acid Database.  It is based on cifparse-prod-v2.  The "real"
version of this, along with documentation, is available from:

    http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu:80/mmcif/software/CIFPARSE/index.html

This library is *only* needed if you want to read and write (primitive)
mmCIF-formatted files in NAB, using the "getcif" and "putcif" modules.
If you need this capability:  (1) do a "make install" in this directory;
(2) edit the Makefile in ../src to add -DMMCIF to the CFLAGS variable;
(3) link in $NABHOME/lib/$ARCH/cifparse.a  when you compile NAB programs
that access cif functionality; you can put this library into your FLIBS
variable if you wish.

  This is only a temporary expedient to "get started" with the mmCIF format.
In particular, the "getcif" function ignores much of what might be in an
mmCIF file, and the "putcif" function writes out an incomplete (but
hopefully useable) file.  Users are stronly encouraged to track the Web
site listed above, since significant extensions of the library are planned.

  The "cif2cif.c" code gives an idea of how the library is used: it simply
reads an mmCIF file on stdin, creating an in-memory version of the data,
then writes this back out to stdout.

  Thanks to John Westbrook for valuable advice, and for permission to 
re-distribute this library.
