The following geometrical and stereochemical features have been calculated 
for your structure.

    CLOSE CONTACTS
    --------------

==> Close contacts in same asymmetric unit.  Distances smaller than 2.2 
    Angstroms are considered as close contacts.                

$$@.1.close@$$

==> Close contacts based on crystal symmetry.  Distances smaller than 2.2
    Angstroms are considered as close contacts.

$$@.close@$$


    BOND DISTANCES AND ANGLES
    -------------------------

==> Bond and angle checks are performed by first computing the average rms
    error for all bonds and angles relative to standard values for nucleotide
    units [L. Clowney et al., Geometric Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Nitrogenous
    Bases, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1996, 118, 509-518; A. Gelbin et al., Geometric
    Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Sugar and Phosphate Constituents, J.Am.Chem.Soc.
    1996, 118, 519-529] and amino acid units [R.A. Engh and R. Huber, Accurate
    Bond and Angle Parameters for X-ray protein structure refinement, Acta
    Crystallogr. 1991, A47, 392-400]. Any bond or angle which deviates from the
    dictionary values by more than six times this computed rms error is 
    identified as an outlier.

    TORSION ANGLES
    --------------

    The torsion angle distributions have been checked.  To view these reports, 
    please refer to the ADIT Validation Server at 
    http://pdb.rutgers.edu/validate.


$$@CHIRALITY@$$
    CHIRALITY
    ---------

     The chirality has been checked. O1P, O2P, and hydrogen atoms which do not
     follow the convention defined in the IUBMB (Liebecq, C. Compendium of 
     Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents, 2nd ed.; Portland Press:
     London and Chapel Hill, 1992) and IUPAC nomenclature (J.L. Markley, A. Bax,
     Y. Arata, C.W. Hilbers, R. Kaptein, B.D. Sykes, P.E. Wright and K. Wüthrich,
     Recommendations for the Presentation of NMR Structures of Proteins and
     Nucleic Acids, Pure & Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, pp. 117-142, 1998) have been 
     standardized.  Any other stereochemical violations are listed below.

$$@CHIRALITY@$$

    SOLVENT 
    -------

    The following solvent molecules are further than 3.5 Angstroms away from
    macromolecule atoms in the asymmetric unit that are available for 
    hydrogen bonding. Solvent molecules in extended hydration shells 
    separated by 3.5 Angstroms or less are not listed.
    
$$@CLOSE CONTACT1@$$

    We have replaced the coordinates for solvent molecules which could be 
    translated back into the asymmetric unit with those listed below.
    Please contact us if you have any serious objections.

$$@CLOSE CONTACT2@$$

    
$$@MISSING RESIDUES@$$
    MISSING RESIDUES
    ----------------

==> The following residues are missing:
    (Note: The SEQ number starts from 1 for each chain according to SEQRES
     sequence record.)
    
     RES MOD#C SEQ

$$@MISSING ATOMS@$$
    MISSING ATOMS
    -------------

==> The following residues have missing atoms:                        

     RES MOD#C SEQ          ATOMS

$$@MISSING ATOMS@$$
$$@EXTRA ATOMS@$$
    EXTRA ATOMS
    -----------

==> The following residues have extra atoms:                         
    
     RES MOD#C SEQ          ATOMS
