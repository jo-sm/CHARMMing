Greetings,

	thank you for depositing your structure with the Nucleic Acid Database
(NDB).  

        Your entry has been assigned the NDB id code $$@NDBFIL 2@$$.  A copy of your
processed NDB file in PDB format is attached.

	After reviewing the entry, please acknowledge receipt of this message,
forward the following part of this letter to us and respond to any issues
raised as a result of our checking.  Please do this within ONE WEEK.  In the
absence of a response from you, this entry will be made available THIRTY DAYS
from the date of this message.  NDB will release this entry at that time
unless you notify us in writing to the contrary.

     Thank you for your time and effort in responding to these points.  In
doing so, you are helping the NDB to make your entry as complete and accurate
as possible.

        If you would like to find out more about the NDB resources, please
visit our World Wide Web site at http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu.


                                     Sincerely yours,

                                     NDB Data Processing Staff

The following checks were made on $$@NDBFIL 2@$$:
-----------------------------------------

DISTANCES AND ANGLES 

We have checked your intra and intermolecular distances and angles with the
procedures currently in place at PDB:

==> The following solvent molecules are further away than 3.5 Angstroms from
    macromolecule atoms which are available for hydrogen bonding in the
    asymmetric unit.
    
$$@CLOSE CONTACT1@$$

    The coordinates for water molecules which could be translated back into
    the asymmetric unit are listed.  If you do not indicate otherwise we will 
    replace the solvent coordinates in the entry with the ones below:

$$@CLOSE CONTACT2@$$


==> Close contacts in same asymmetric unit.  Distances smaller than 2.2 
    Angstroms are considered as close contacts.                

$$@.1.close@$$

==> Close contacts based on crystal symmetry.  Distances smaller than 2.2
    Angstroms are considered as close contacts.

$$@.close@$$

==> Bond and angle checks are performed by first computing the average rms
    error for all bonds and angles relative to standard values for nucleotide
    units [L. Clowney et al., Geometric Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Nitrogenous
    Bases, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1996, 118, 509-518; A. Gelbin et al., Geometric
    Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Sugar and Phosphate Constituents, J.Am.Chem.Soc.
    1996, 118, 519-529] and amino acid units [R.A. Engh and R. Huber, Accurate
    Bond and Angle Parameters for X-ray protein structure refinement, Acta
    Crystallogr. 1991, A47, 392-400]. Any bond or angle which deviates from the
    dictionary values by more than six times this computed rms error is 
    identified as an outlier.

    *** Covalent Angle Values:

TORSION ANGLES
 
The torsion angle distributions have been checked.  The postscript file of the
conformation rings showing the torsion angle distributions will be sent in a
separate E-mail message.


$$@CHIRALITY@$$
CHIRALITY

The chirality has been checked and there are no incorrect carbon chiral centers.
Some of O1P and O2P atoms do not follow the convention defined in the standard 
IUBMB nomenclature (Liebecq, C. Compendium of Biochemical Nomenclature and Related 
Documents, 2nd ed.; Portland Press: London and Chapel Hill, 1992). If you do not 
indicate otherwise, we will switch the labels of O1P and O2P as shown below.

    appropriate.

    
$$@MISSING RESIDUES@$$

     sequence record.)

$$@HYDROGEN ATOMS@$$
==> Your file contains hydrogen atoms. Do you wish to keep the hydrogen atoms in your
    coordinates file or allow us to delete the hydrogen atoms?

$$@REPRINTS@$$
==> Because we did not get the (p)reprint of the paper, we did the best we could.
    Please check every item very carefully.
