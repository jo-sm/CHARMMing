Dear Dr. $$@PROCES 7@$$,

	Thank you for depositing your structure with the Nucleic Acid Database
(NDB).  As part of an agreement with the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we process
all oligonucleotide structures.  When the file is processed, we forward the
entry directly to the PDB for inclusion in their archive.  If you would like
to find out more about the NDB resources, please visit our World Wide Web site
at http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu.

	Your entry has been assigned the NDB id code $$@NDBFIL 2@$$.  A copy of your 
processed NDB file in PDB format will accompany this letter as a separate 
E-mail message.

	After reviewing the entry, please acknowledge receipt of this message,
forward the following part of this letter to us and respond to any issues
raised as a result of our checking.  Please do this within TWO WEEKS.  In the
absence of a response from you, this entry will be made available THIRTY DAYS
from the date of this message.  NDB will release this entry at that time
unless you notify us in writing to the contrary.

===============================================================================

Entry $$@NDBFIL 2@$$:

$$@HEADER@$$
$$@COMPND@$$
$$@AUTHOR@$$

[ ] I give permission to release entry $$@NDBFIL 2@$$ without further corrections. 

$$@PUBLICATION@$$
[ ] I wish to hold entry $$@NDBFIL 2@$$ until publication.
$$@else@$$
[ ] I wish to hold the coordinates of entry $$@NDBFIL 2@$$ until $$@RELEAS 4@$$.  
$$@PUBLICATION@$$

[ ] I give permission to release entry $$@NDBFIL 2@$$ after the enclosed corrections 
have been made.  (You may change single words or replace the entire entry.)

===============================================================================



     Thank you for your time and effort in responding to these points.  In
doing so, you are helping the NDB to make your entry as complete and accurate
as possible.


                                     Sincerely yours,

                                     NDB Data Processing Staff

The following checks were made on $$@NDBFIL 2@$$:
-----------------------------------------

CLOSE CONTACTS

==> Distances smaller than 2.2 Angstroms are considered as close contacts
    for heavy atoms, 1.6 Angstroms for hydrogens.

$$@.1.close@$$


DISTANCES AND ANGLES 

We have checked your intra and intermolecular distances and angles with the
procedures currently in place at PDB:

==> Bond and angle checks are performed by first computing the average rms
    error for all bonds and angles relative to standard values for nucleotide
    units [L. Clowney et al., Geometric Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Nitrogenous
    Bases, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1996, 118, 509-518; A. Gelbin et al., Geometric
    Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Sugar and Phosphate Constituents, J.Am.Chem.Soc.
    1996, 118, 519-529] and amino acid units [R.A. Engh and R. Huber, Accurate
    Bond and Angle Parameters for X-ray protein structure refinement, Acta
    Crystallogr. 1991, A47, 392-400]. Any bond or angle which deviates from the
    dictionary values by more than six times this computed rms error is 
    identified as an outlier.

    *** Covalent Angle Values:

$$@.cov-angle-rpt@$$


TORSION ANGLES
 
The torsion angle distributions have been checked.  The postscript file of the
conformation rings showing the torsion angle distributions will be sent in a
separate E-mail message.


$$@CHIRALITY@$$
CHIRALITY

The chirality has been checked. O1P, O2P, and hydrogen atoms which do not
follow the convention defined in the IUBMB (Liebecq, C. Compendium of
Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents, 2nd ed.; Portland Press:
London and Chapel Hill, 1992) and IUPAC nomenclature (J.L. Markley, A. Bax,
Y. Arata, C.W. Hilbers, R. Kaptein, B.D. Sykes, P.E. Wright and K. Wüthrich,
Recommendations for the Presentation of NMR Structures of Proteins and
Nucleic Acids, Pure & Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, pp. 117-142, 1998) have been
standardized.  Any other stereochemical violations are listed below.

$$@CHIRALITY@$$

$$@EZ@$$
E/Z NOMENCLATURE

E/Z nomenclature of hydrogens and/or nitrogens on Arg, Asn or Gln residues needs
to be corrected to conform with the standard for E/Z orientation presented in
[J.L. Markley, et al., Recommendations for the Presentation of NMR Structures of
Proteins and Nucleic Acids, Pure & Appl. Chem., 1998, 70, 117-142].
