Thank you for using RCSB.  The following geometrical and stereochemical 
features have been calculated for your structure:

    CLOSE CONTACTS
    --------------

==> Distances smaller than 2.2 Angstroms are considered as close contacts
    for heavy atoms, 1.6 Angstroms for hydrogens.

$$@.1.close@$$


    BOND DISTANCES AND ANGLES
    -------------------------

==> Bond and angle checks are performed by first computing the average rms
    error for all bonds and angles relative to standard values for nucleotide
    units [L. Clowney et al., Geometric Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Nitrogenous
    Bases, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1996, 118, 509-518; A. Gelbin et al., Geometric
    Parameters in Nucleic Acids: Sugar and Phosphate Constituents, J.Am.Chem.Soc.
    1996, 118, 519-529] and amino acid units [R.A. Engh and R. Huber, Accurate
    Bond and Angle Parameters for X-ray protein structure refinement, Acta
    Crystallogr. 1991, A47, 392-400]. Any bond or angle which deviates from the
    dictionary values by more than six times this computed rms error is 
    identified as an outlier.

    *** Covalent Angle Values:

    TORSION ANGLES
    --------------

    The torsion angle distributions have been checked.  Refer to the
    Procheck and/or Nucheck results on the RCSB Validation Report page.


$$@CHIRALITY@$$
    CHIRALITY
    ---------
    
    The chirality has been checked. O1P, O2P, and hydrogen atoms which do not
    follow the conventions defined by IUBMB (Liebecq, C. Compendium of 
    Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents, 2nd ed.; Portland Press:
    London and Chapel Hill, 1992) and IUPAC (J.L. Markley, A. Bax,
    Y. Arata, C.W. Hilbers, R. Kaptein, B.D. Sykes, P.E. Wright and K. Wüthrich,
    Recommendations for the Presentation of NMR Structures of Proteins and
    Nucleic Acids, Pure & Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, pp. 117-142, 1998) will be  
    standardized at the time of processing; there is no need to change these 
    labels in your coordinate file.  Any other stereochemical violations are
    listed below.

    HYDROGEN NOMENCLATURE
    ---------------------

    The nomenclature of hydrogens has been checked for compliance with PDB
    standards. There is no need to change these labels in your coordinate
    file; if necessary they will be changed at the time of processing.

    The nomenclature of hydrogens on the ND2 atoms of Asn residues and/or the 
    NE2 atoms of Gln as well as the NH1 and NH2 atoms of Arg residues and their 
    associated hydrogens have been checked for agreement with the standard for
    E/Z orientation presented in [J.L. Markley, et al., Recommendations for the 
    Presentation of NMR Structures of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, Pure & Appl.
    Chem., 1998, 70, 117-142]. There is no need to change these labels in your
    coordinate file; if necessary they will be changed at the time of processing.

    MISSING RESIDUES
    ----------------

==> The following residues are missing:
    (Note: The SEQ number starts from 1 for each chain according to SEQRES
     sequence record.)
    
     RES MOD#C SEQ          

$$@MISSING RESIDUES@$$
$$@MISSING ATOMS@$$
    MISSING ATOMS
    -------------

==> The following residues have missing atoms:                        

     RES MOD#C SEQ          ATOMS

$$@MISSING ATOMS@$$
$$@EXTRA ATOMS@$$

==> The following residues have extra atoms:
