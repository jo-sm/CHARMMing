! the total charge on the system must be 0 or else Ewald will not work correctly, we need to test for this...
! we do the almost equal if test to avoid floating point rounding errors.
scalar charge stat sele all end
if ?stot .ae. 0 then goto okewald
! uh-oh, total charge != 0, we cannot proceed, set the bomlev to an absurdly high level
! to force a bailout.
bomlev 5
Achtung, dynamics with particle-mesh ewald only works on a structure with 0 total charge!!!!

label okewald
