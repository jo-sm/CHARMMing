! We do not want to allow atoms not known natively by the CHARMM force field (i.e. those generated
! by GENRTF) to move during the minimization. Therefore, we define all residues that CHARMM's force
! field does know about and use a  constraint to fix all other atoms. Note that this may be overridden
